So how long
Were you numb
'Cause it was cold as ice

And I keep saying
That I'm Ok with it
But that's another lie
The truth is I've 
been dying slowly

But no, not you - you just
Turned to drift into the nights
A parting scene of empathy
And instant shift to a
Stone heart paired with empty eyes
That stare right through mine

I did the math, but it just don't add up
There's the whole world that used be us
Now there's an echo calling me, just a shred of memory
Emptiness, but there's still a shadow
I catch a glimpse of someone I should know
Hard to tell if you were even here
I disappear, disappear
